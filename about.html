    	<h1>Who am I?</h1>
		<p>Hi there! I am Charlie Matwijkiw. A 24-year-old non-binary person, who lives in Denmark, Grenaa. Whilst I prefer, They/Them pronouns I am definitely not a stickler and really don’t mind what you use. It’s hard and very new for most people. That in itself shows who I am actually. I see myself as openminded, able to put myself in other shoes and it comes very natural for me to accommodate others needs.</p>
		<p>I might be a bit of a silent and shy person the first time you meet me. Might even get very awkward, but as soon as we get to know each other better, I become a very energetic person. I’ve been told when that happens, I really hype others up and in general creates a more fun and engaging environment. </p>
		<h1>Hobbies!</h1>
		<p>Whilst I am a huge gaming nerd, I do have hobbies that isn’t strictly gaming related too! I love being creative, 
		so I try to be as creative as I can. An old hobby I recently have started up again is drawing. I am a bit of a 
		perfectionist, so I rarely satisfied with them and therefore rarely shared, but once in a blue moon I do create 
		something that looks decent. My sister Simone could beat me any day of the week when it comes to drawing 
		talent though. As I suck at perspectives, I mostly do logo or UI art in a clean cartoonish style. Kind of like the 
		logo for this website.
		</p>
		<p>As mentioned, I sometimes write reviews for games. Well, that did eventually lead me to writing larger pieces of 
		fiction. As I like writing as much as I do, it only came natural to start writing books. A hobby I can thank my 
		good, good friend Kim for starting. She was the one who told me what the best way to start was and help me 
		get over my insecurities towards it. As of right now I have only written a Novella called “Within Me”, but I have 2 
		other novellas planned and a full Novel in pre-production.</p>
